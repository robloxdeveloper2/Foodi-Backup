# Story 1.3: Profile Refinement and Management

## Status: InProgress

## Story

- As a registered user
- I want to be able to view and update my profile information at any time

   - Proper error handling for failed updates

5. Security:
   - Proper authentication required
   - Validation of user permissions
   - Protection against unauthorized modifications

## Dev Technical Guidance

1. Follow the architecture's data management strategy:
   - Use PostgreSQL for core profile data
   - Use MongoDB for preference data
   - Ensure atomic updates across both databases
2. Implement proper state management in Flutter:
   - Use Provider/Riverpod as specified in architecture
   - Handle loading and error states
3. Follow security best practices:
   - Validate JWT tokens
   - Implement proper authorization checks
4. Use proper logging:
   - Log all profile changes
   - Track failed update attempts
5. Follow error handling strategy:
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Handle network issues gracefully
6. Implement proper form validation:
   - Use Pydantic models in backend
   - Implement client-side validation in Flutter
