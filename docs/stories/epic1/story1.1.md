# Story 1.1: User Account Creation

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a new user I want to create an account with my email and password or via social login so that I can access Foodi's features
- For testing purposes, make it easy to test without needing to create an account.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. User can register using email/password:
   - Email must be valid format and unique in the system
   - Password must meet security requirements (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number)
   - System validates and provides clear error messages if requirements not met
   
2. User can register using social login:
   - Support for Google authentication
   - Support for Apple authentication
   - System extracts necessary profile information from social provider

3. Upon successful registration:
   - User receives email confirmation
   - JWT token is generated and returned
   - User is redirected to the onboarding flow

4. System securely stores user credentials:
   - Passwords are properly hashed using industry-standard algorithms
   - No plain text passwords are stored
   - Email addresses are stored with proper encryption

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Backend Implementation (AC: 1,3,4)
  - [x] Create User model in PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy
  - [x] Implement password hashing using bcrypt
  - [x] Create /api/v1/users/register endpoint
  - [x] Implement email validation logic
  - [x] Set up JWT token generation
  - [x] Configure email service for confirmation emails
  
- [x] Frontend Implementation (AC: 1,2,3)
  - [x] Create registration form UI with email/password fields
  - [x] Add form validation for email and password requirements
  - [x] Implement social login buttons and handlers
  - [x] Create success/error message displays
  - [x] Add loading states during submission
  
- [x] Testing (AC: All)
  - [x] Write unit tests for validation logic
  - [x] Write integration tests for registration flow
  - [x] Test error scenarios and edge cases
  - [x] Test social login integration
  
- [x] Security Review (AC: 4)
  - [x] Review password hashing implementation
  - [x] Verify JWT token security
  - [x] Check for any potential security vulnerabilities

## Dev Technical Guidance

1. Use Flask-JWT-Extended for token management as specified in architecture doc
2. Implement using Flutter for frontend following the project structure in arch doc
3. Use Pydantic for request/response validation
4. Follow the error handling strategy outlined in architecture doc
5. Ensure proper logging is implemented for debugging and monitoring
6. Use PostgreSQL for user data storage with proper indexing on email field
7. Implement rate limiting on registration endpoint to prevent abuse
