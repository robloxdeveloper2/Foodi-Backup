## Dev Technical Guidance

1. Use hybrid database approach as specified in architecture:
   - PostgreSQL for core user profile data
   - MongoDB for flexible preference data
2. Implement proper data validation using Pydantic models
3. Follow Flutter's form management best practices
4. Ensure proper error handling for all user inputs
5. Implement proper state management for multi-step form
6. Use proper type safety in both frontend and backend
7. Follow the project's logging standards for debugging
