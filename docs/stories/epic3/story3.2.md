# Story 3.2: Recipe Details & Cooking Instructions

**Status: Review**

## User Story

**As a user, when I select a recipe, I want to view comprehensive details including ingredients, step-by-step instructions, nutritional information, and cooking tips, so that I can successfully prepare the dish.**

Use placeholders for images

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Step-by-step instructions are clearly numbered and easy to follow
- [x] Prep time, cook time, and total time are prominently displayed
- [x] Nutritional information per serving is shown (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
- [x] Difficulty level and cooking tips are provided
- [x] User can check off completed steps while cooking
- [ ] User can share recipe via standard device sharing options (pending share_plus dependency)

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Flask)

**âœ… COMPLETED:**

#### Existing API Endpoints (Already Available from Story 3.1)
- `GET /api/v1/recipes/<recipe_id>` - Get detailed recipe information (already implemented)

#### Enhanced Recipe Model (`backend/src/core/models/recipe.py`)
- âœ… Added `detailed_instructions` JSON field for step-by-step instructions
- âœ… Added `cooking_tips` JSON field for cooking advice
- âœ… Added `equipment_needed` JSON field for required equipment
- âœ… Enhanced `ingredients` to support substitutions
- âœ… Added `get_instructions_list()` method for formatted steps
- âœ… Added `scale_recipe()` method for portion scaling

#### New API Endpoints
- âœ… `POST /api/v1/recipes/<recipe_id>/scale` - Scale recipe portions

### Frontend (Flutter)

**âœ… COMPLETED:**

- âœ… `IngredientWithSubstitutions` - Ingredient with alternative options
- âœ… `CookingSession` - Track user's cooking progress
- âœ… `RecipeScaling` - Handle portion scaling calculations
- âœ… `CookingTip` - Cooking tips with categories

#### Services (`frontend/lib/services/recipe_detail_service.dart`)
- âœ… API integration for recipe details
- âœ… Recipe scaling functionality
- âœ… Shareable text generation
- âœ… Recipe validation and utility methods

#### Local Storage (`frontend/lib/utils/local_storage_service.dart`)
- âœ… Cooking session persistence
- âœ… Step completion tracking storage

#### State Management (`frontend/lib/providers/recipe_detail_provider.dart`)
- âœ… Recipe detail state management
- âœ… Cooking session tracking (start, pause, resume, end)
- âœ… Recipe scaling functionality
- âœ… Step completion tracking
- âœ… Error handling and loading states

#### UI Components
- âœ… `RecipeDetailScreen` - Main recipe detail view with full functionality

- âœ… `IngredientsList` - Scalable ingredients with substitutions
- âœ… `CookingInstructions` - Step-by-step instructions with checkboxes
- âœ… `NutritionCard` - Nutritional information display
- âœ… `RecipeScalingControl` - Portion scaling controls

## Implementation Status

### âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES:

#### Backend Features:
1. **Enhanced Recipe Model**: Complete support for detailed instructions, cooking tips, equipment
2. **Recipe Scaling**: Fully functional API endpoint for dynamic portion scaling with proper calculations
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Seamless fallback from text instructions to structured steps
4. **Ingredient Substitutions**: Framework for alternative ingredient suggestions

#### Frontend Features:
1. **Comprehensive Models**: All data structures for recipe details and cooking sessions
2. **Service Layer**: Complete API integration with robust error handling
3. **State Management**: Fully functional provider with cooking session tracking
4. **Local Storage**: Persistent cooking progress across app restarts
5. **Complete UI**: All components implemented and integrated
6. **Linting**: Code passes all Flutter analysis checks

### ðŸ”„ PENDING (Dependencies Required):
1. **Native Sharing**: Requires `share_plus` package approval for device sharing
2. **Authentication Integration**: Replace dummy tokens with real auth service
3. **Navigation Integration**: Connect to recipe discovery screen

### âœ… QUALITY ASSURANCE:
- **Code Quality**: All files pass Flutter analyzer with zero issues
- **Architecture**: Follows established patterns and project structure
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Performance**: Includes debouncing, lazy loading, and caching strategies
- **Accessibility**: Material Design components with semantic support

## Performance Considerations

- **Image Loading**: âœ… Progressive image loading with placeholders (implemented in header)
- **Tab Lazy Loading**: âœ… Load tab content only when viewed (implemented in main screen)
- **Recipe Caching**: âœ… Cache recipe details for offline viewing (local storage ready)
- **Smooth Scaling**: âœ… Debounce scaling operations to avoid excessive calculations (provider level)
- **Step Progress Persistence**: âœ… Save cooking progress locally for app restarts (implemented)

## Accessibility Features

- **Screen Reader**: âœ… Comprehensive labels for all recipe elements (Material widgets)
- **Large Text**: âœ… Support for dynamic text scaling in instructions (Material widgets)
- **High Contrast**: âœ… Theme-aware widgets ensure readability in high contrast mode
- **Step Focus**: âœ… Clear focus indicators for cooking steps (implemented in CookingInstructions)
- **Voice Navigation**: ðŸ”„ Consider voice commands for hands-free cooking (future enhancement)

## Success Metrics

- **Detail View Engagement**: Time spent on recipe detail pages (tracking ready)
- **Scaling Usage**: Frequency of recipe scaling operations (tracked in provider)
- **Cooking Mode Adoption**: Users who start cooking sessions (tracked in provider)
- **Step Completion**: Average cooking step completion rates (tracked in sessions)
- **Share Rate**: Recipe sharing frequency via native sharing (ready for implementation)
