# Story 3.1: Recipe Catalog Discovery

**Status: InProgress**

## User Story

**As a user, I want to browse and search through a comprehensive recipe catalog with advanced filtering options, so that I can discover new recipes that match my dietary preferences, cooking skill level, and time constraints.**

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] User can view a paginated grid/list of recipe cards
- [x] User can search recipes by name or ingredients using a search bar
- [x] User can filter recipes by:
  - Dietary restrictions (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, keto, etc.)
  - Meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, dessert)
  - Cuisine type (Italian, Asian, Mexican, etc.)
  - Cooking time (≤15 min, 15-30 min, 30-60 min, >60 min)
  - Difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
  - Cost estimate (budget-friendly, moderate, premium)
- [x] Recipe cards display key information: image, name, prep time, difficulty, dietary tags, estimated cost
- [x] Filtering and search results update in real-time
- [x] User can clear all filters with a single action
- [x] Search suggestions appear as user types

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Flask)

**✅ COMPLETED:**

#### API Endpoints (`backend/src/api/recipes.py`)
- `GET /api/v1/recipes/search` - Search and filter recipes with pagination
- `GET /api/v1/recipes/<recipe_id>` - Get detailed recipe information
- `GET /api/v1/recipes/filters/options` - Get available filter options
- `GET /api/v1/recipes/suggestions` - Get search suggestions
- `GET /api/v1/recipes/trending` - Get trending/popular recipes
- `GET /api/v1/recipes/personalized` - Get personalized recommendations

#### Service Layer (`backend/src/services/recipe_discovery_service.py`)
- Comprehensive search with text matching across name, description, ingredients
- Advanced filtering by meal type, cuisine, dietary restrictions, difficulty, time, cost
- Pagination with configurable page size
- Sorting by multiple criteria (name, prep time, cost, difficulty, date)
- Search suggestions with debouncing
- Trending recipes based on creation date
- Personalized recommendations (basic implementation)

#### Integration
- Recipe blueprint registered in main Flask app
- Uses existing Recipe model and RecipeRepository
- Follows established error handling and logging patterns

### Frontend (Flutter)

**✅ COMPLETED:**

#### Models (`frontend/lib/models/recipe_models.dart`)
- `Recipe` - Complete recipe model with nutritional info, ingredients, metadata
- `RecipeSearchResult` - Search results with pagination info
- `RecipeFilters` - Comprehensive filter options with query parameter conversion
- `FilterOptions` - Available filter choices from backend
- Supporting models: `Ingredient`, `NutritionalInfo`, `RecipePagination`, etc.

#### Services (`frontend/lib/services/recipe_discovery_service.dart`)
- Full API integration with all backend endpoints
- Error handling and loading states
- Convenience methods for common searches (quick recipes, budget-friendly, etc.)

#### State Management (`frontend/lib/providers/recipe_discovery_provider.dart`)
- Comprehensive state management with ChangeNotifier
- Debounced search with 500ms delay
- Real-time filter updates
- Infinite scroll pagination
- Search suggestions with 300ms debounce
- Trending recipes and personalized recommendations
- Loading states for all operations

#### UI Components

**Main Screen (`frontend/lib/screens/recipe_discovery/recipe_discovery_screen.dart`)**
- Modern, responsive layout with search header
- Infinite scroll with pull-to-refresh
- Active filter chips with individual removal
- Sort options modal
- Trending recipes section when no search/filters
- Empty states and error handling

**Widgets:**
- `RecipeSearchBar` - Search input with live suggestions dropdown
- `RecipeCard` - Attractive recipe cards with images, stats, dietary tags
- `RecipeGrid` - Responsive grid layout (2-4 columns based on screen size)
- `RecipeFilterSheet` - Comprehensive bottom sheet with all filter options
- `TrendingRecipesSection` - Horizontal scrolling trending recipes + quick filter chips

**Common Widgets:**
- `LoadingIndicator` - Consistent loading spinner
- `ErrorMessage` - Error display with retry functionality
- `EmptyState` - Empty state with icon and message

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: ✅ Implemented infinite scroll with pagination
- **Image Optimization**: ✅ Use cached network images with placeholder and error widgets
- **Debounced Search**: ✅ Implement search debouncing (500ms) to avoid excessive API calls
- **Filter Caching**: ✅ Cache filter options to avoid repeated API calls
- **Recipe Card Optimization**: ✅ Use `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` for recipe cards in scroll views

## Accessibility Features

- **Screen Reader Support**: ✅ Add semantic labels for all interactive elements
- **High Contrast**: ✅ Ensure adequate color contrast for text and backgrounds
- **Large Text**: ✅ Support dynamic text scaling
- **Keyboard Navigation**: ✅ Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard
- **Focus Management**: ✅ Proper focus handling for filter sheets and search

## Success Metrics

- **Search Usage**: Track search query frequency and patterns
- **Filter Adoption**: Monitor which filters are most commonly used
- **Recipe Discovery**: Measure recipe card tap-through rates
- **Search Success**: Track searches that result in recipe selections
- **Performance**: Monitor page load times and infinite scroll performance
