# Story 2.1: Algorithm-Based Meal Plan Generation

**Status: InProgress**

## User Story
**As a** registered user  
**I want** Foodi to generate comprehensive daily and weekly meal plans using smart algorithms based on my specified budget, dietary restrictions, nutritional goals, and preferences  
**So that** I have a structured eating guide that fits my lifestyle and constraints

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC 2.1.1**: User can request meal plan generation from main dashboard
- [ ] **AC 2.1.2**: Generated meal plan includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and optional snacks for specified time period (1-7 days)
- [ ] **AC 2.1.3**: Total estimated cost of meal plan stays within user's specified budget (¬±10% tolerance)
- [ ] **AC 2.1.4**: All recipes in meal plan respect user's dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- [ ] **AC 2.1.5**: Meal plan nutritional totals align with user's stated goals (weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance)
- [ ] **AC 2.1.6**: User can regenerate meal plan if unsatisfied with initial suggestions
- [ ] **AC 2.1.7**: Generated meal plan is saved and accessible for future viewing
- [ ] **AC 2.1.8**: System provides nutritional summary (calories, macros) for the entire meal plan

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Algorithmic Approach
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/meal-plans/generate`
- **Algorithm Logic** (`src/services/meal_planning_service.py`):
  ```python
  # Meal Planning Algorithm:
  # 1. Filter recipes by dietary restrictions
  # 2. Calculate daily calorie target based on user goals
  # 3. Score recipes by: cost efficiency, nutritional fit, cuisine variety
  # 4. Use constraint satisfaction to select optimal combination
  # 5. Ensure meal type distribution (breakfast/lunch/dinner)
  # 6. Apply variety rules (no repeated recipes in same week)
  ```

### Scoring System
- Cost efficiency (cost per calorie)
- Nutritional alignment (protein/carb/fat ratios)
- User experience level match (prep complexity)
- Cuisine diversity bonus

### Database Schema
- **PostgreSQL**: Store meal plans in `meal_plans` table
- **MongoDB**: Store user preferences in `user_preferences` collection

### Frontend Implementation
- **Screen**: `lib/features/meal_planning/presentation/screens/meal_plan_generation_screen.dart`
- **Widgets**: 
  - `meal_plan_generator_widget.dart`
  - `generation_progress_indicator.dart`
  - `meal_plan_summary_card.dart`
